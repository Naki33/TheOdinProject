<h3>One of the most known dishes of Italians</h3>

<p>The history of <strong>Alla Carbonara</strong>:</p>

<p>As with many recipes, the origins of the dish and its name are obscure; most sources trace its origin to the region of Lazio.

    The dish forms part of a family of dishes involving pasta with bacon, cheese, and pepper, one of which is pasta alla gricia. Indeed, it is very similar to pasta cacio e uova, a dish dressed with melted lard and a mixture of eggs and cheese, which is documented as long ago as 1839, and, according to some researchers and older Italians, may have been the pre-Second World War name of carbonara.
    
    There are many theories for the origin of the name "carbonara", which is likely more recent than the dish itself. There is no good evidence for any of them:
    
    Since the name is derived from carbonaro (the Italian word for "charcoal burner"), some believe the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers. In parts of the United States, this etymology gave rise to the term "coal miner's spaghetti".
    It has even been suggested that it was created as a tribute to the Carbonari ("charcoal men") secret society prominent in the early, repressed stages of Italian unification in the early 19th century.
    It seems more likely that it is an "urban dish" from Rome, perhaps popularized by the restaurant La Carbonara in Rome.
    The names pasta alla carbonara and spaghetti alla carbonara are unrecorded before the Second World War; notably, it is absent from Ada Boni's 1930 La Cucina romana ("Roman cuisine").
    
    In the Guide of Italy of the TCI, 1931 edition, is recorded a pasta (strascinati) dish from Cascia and Monteleone di Spoleto in Umbria, whose sauce contains whipped eggs and pork fat and lean, and could be considered as a precursor of Carbonara.
    
    The name "carbonara" is first attested in 1950, when it was described in the Italian newspaper La Stampa as a Roman dish sought out by American officers after the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944. It was described as a "Roman dish" at a time when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by troops from the United States.

<h3>Recepie instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The pasta is cooked in moderately salted boiling water, due to the saltiness of the cured meat and the hard cheese. The meat is briefly fried in a pan in its own fat.</li>
    <li>A mixture of raw eggs (or yolks), grated cheese, and a liberal amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish but away from direct heat, to avoid curdling the egg.</li>
    <li>The fried meat is then added and the mixture is tossed, creating a rich, creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout.</li>
    <li>Although various shapes of pasta can be used, the raw egg can only cook properly with a shape that has a sufficiently large ratio of surface area to volume, such as the long, thin types fettuccine, linguine, tagliatelle or spaghetti.</li>
