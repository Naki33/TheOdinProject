<h1>Risotto</h1>

<h4>The history of risotto:</h4>

<p>Rice was introduced to Sicily and Spain in the 14th century by the Arabs. Rice cultivation continued in Naples and eventually extended to northern Italy via the marshes of the Po river valley. The Mediterranean climate with high humidity was conducive to growing short- and medium-grained rice. The city-states and elites of Milan, Venice, and Genoa were buoyed with profits from this new commodity. Combined with the influx of spices from the East, it accelerated risotto's popularity throughout the region.

    Milan was ruled by Spain, and it is in that era Spanish saffron accounts for another famous rice preparation — paella. That is another story, however.
    
    Legend has it that a church-sponsored stained-glass colorist was pranked by an assistant in September 1574 when he added a pinch of saffron to his maestros risotto and the defining recipe Risotto alla Milanese was born.
    
    Up until the 18th century risotto included boiled rice as an ingredient. The recipe version that most resembles what we eat in the 21st century was first published in 1829. It included roasting the rice with butter and onion, then adding broth little-by-little while stirring continuously until it was creamy and rich.</p>

<h2>Ingriedients for Risotto</h2>

<ul>
    <li>RICE</li>
    <li>ONIONS</li>
    <li>BROTH OR STOCK</li>
    <li>CHEESE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>It starts by sautéing onion — and possibly garlic if you would like — in butter or olive oil. Add the rice and make sure it is covered with the fat that you are using and starting to toast.</li>
    <li>At this point the pan is deglazed with white wine to add some acidity to the mix, and that is reduced and absorbed.</li>
    <li>Then it is time for the stirring to begin. Addition after addition of stock is incorporated until each is mostly absorbed, and after a bit the creamy signature begins to appear. In perfectly cooked risotto, the rice grain is cooked but retains a nut-like core so it is al dente, or “to the bite”.</li>
    <li>Add some grated hard cheese like Reggiano or Romano, then season with salt and pepper to taste and you are done.</li>
